We are interested in subsurface water influence on precipitation
Literature motivations: 
(1) Tuttle (2016) via Granger causality: changes in surface soil moisture can help predict subsequent precipitation events
(2) Dirmeyer (2011) via land–atmosphere model experiments: soil moisture correlates with rainfall on weeks-to-months timescales
We hope to contribute to the body of research evaluating the role of land surface as a memory and modulator of the hydrological cycle. 
Upper soil layers act as a fast-to-medium memory in the coupled system, but do deeper layers of soil and groundwater contribute to precipitation variability?

Modeling studies showing GW impact on precipitation (medium-to-slow moving feedback in the land-atmosphere system):
(1) Barlage (2017)
(2) Anyah (2008)
(3) Martinez (2016)
(4) Adole (2018) --> vegetation greening precedes the first rain in Sahel
(5) Wright (2017) --> Model based studies of Congo suggest that early-season soil moisture and veg feedbacks:
      a) precondition rainfall
      b) accelerate monsson onset
      c) influence larger_scale circulation to bring in ocean moisture earlier
However, there are limitations in the stable isotop analyses, highlighting a need for 
additional observationally constrained approaches to verify the influence of deep subsurface water

We will use Vector AutoRegression (VAR) to leverage 3 parts:
(1) Granger causality
(2) Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)- introduce a single anomalous pulse to on evariable and trace how the disturbance propagates through the system over months
      a) If we see in the IRF that there an acceleration of the rainfall froma  change in the deep subsurface water, this will support the theory that ET from land triggers the wet season
(3) Forecast Error Variacne Decomposition (FEVD)

Q: Can deep terrestrial water storage in month, t, improve our forecast of precipitation in future month, t+3,
   better than the precipitation record alone? If it can, than storage is said to Granger-cause precipitation.
> This will provide meaningful evidence of directional predictive influence flowing from one part of the system to another.

Q: Can layers beneath the top 5 cm, including those deeper than 1 m, have predictive power for rainfall and wet season onset?
   IRF will provide an understanding of the timing and persistence of the precipitation response in reaching to each subsurface layer
   FEVD will help quantify the relative contribution of each subsurface layer to precipitation variability
