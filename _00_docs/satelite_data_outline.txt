    > GRACE is sensitive to *all* mass changes, and thus measures the vertically integrated change in mass. 
    To use GRACE to constrain a subset of the vertical mass budget, e.g. snow or groundwater, one must use 
    independent data to remove the other components of the mass budget.  Filtering the data is an important 
    step in reducing measurement error, but it comes at the expense of signal modification.  Performing 
    simulations in which the data processing methods are applied to synthetic datasets provides valuable 
    information on the effects of filtering and regularization.
